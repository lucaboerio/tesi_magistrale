The main objects of this work are the wide category of regime shift phenomena and
the forecasting of these phenomena. Regime shifts are large, abrupt changes in the
structure or trend of ecosystems, climate, financial systems, or complex, physical,
dynamical systems; in general, it regards all those situations in which a system is
at a critical point, where even the smallest perturbation can dramatically change
the course of that phenomenon.
